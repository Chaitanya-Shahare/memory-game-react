# Memory Game

Live demo: https://memory-game-react-silk.vercel.app/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Todo

- [ ] Create a game board component
- [ ] Create a game card component
- [ ] Functionality to flip card to show & hide the value
- [ ] Randomize the card values

- [ ] Cooldown time after flipping 2 cards
  - [ ] disable all the inputs for 3 seconds
  - [ ] hide the cards if they don't match
